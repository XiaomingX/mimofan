> A **reproducible, practical, and learnable** Spring Boot web security experiment framework that helps developers quickly master the principles of web security vulnerabilities and defense solutions.


## 📖 Project Introduction
**Java Security Education Framework (JSEF)** is a web security practice platform built on Spring Boot 3.x, designed specifically for **developers, security researchers, university students, and corporate training**. Through **35+ real-world business scenario-based security vulnerability examples** (covering core types such as injection attacks, privilege escalation, and sensitive information leakage), it provides a complete learning loop of "**Principle Explanation → Vulnerability Reproduction → Code Comparison → Fix Verification**", helping learners quickly grasp core web security capabilities from "theory" to "practice".

This project does not rely on complex environments, supporting one-click local startup and Docker deployment. All vulnerability cases are designed based on real business logic, avoiding "vulnerabilities created merely for demonstration purposes" and being more aligned with actual development scenarios.

**New Structure Note:** The project code has been refactored. All vulnerability-related controllers are now located under the `com.freedom.securitysamples.vulnerability` package. Each vulnerability category is further divided into `vuln` (containing insecure/vulnerable implementations) and `sec` (containing secure/fixed implementations) sub-packages for direct comparative learning. API routes have also been unified to the format `/api/v1/{vulnerability-type}/unsafe/{scenario}` and `/api/v1/{vulnerability-type}/safe/{scenario}`.

## 🔬 SAST Capability & Multi-Model Vulnerability-Hunting Benchmark

JSEF is not only a teaching platform, but also ships a benchmark for **validating basic SAST capabilities** and **comparing vulnerability-hunting ability across multiple LLMs**. The design is based on first principles of SAST (proof of untrusted-data reachability from source to sink). Samples carry a discriminating-difficulty gradient, making it easy to cross-compare false positives, false negatives, average time, timeouts, report conciseness, and coverage completeness.

### Core Capabilities

| Capability Dimension | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Taint propagation (no variable break) | Single-hop / multi-hop / indirect (Map/field) gradient, checking whether intermediate variables drop taint |
| State machine / call-chain tracking | Cross-method / cross-file / gadget chain, checking reachability analysis depth |
| Framework semantics understanding | Spring parameter binding, SpEL, `@RequestParam`-driven implicit source/sink |
| False-positive suppression | OWASP-style true/false confusion samples, checking discrimination of "looks dangerous but safe" code |

### Samples & Difficulty Grading

Samples are graded **L0-L5** (each level increases reasoning distance and semantic dependency to separate tools/models by tier; L0 is the capability baseline that all tools/models should hit):

| Level | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| L0 | Capability baseline (explicit direct) | source passed straight to sink, no intermediate |
| L1 | Single-hop direct | `Runtime.exec(userInput)` |
| L2 | Multi-hop (no break) | source -> intermediate var -> builder -> sink |
| L3 | Indirect / cross-method | taint via Map/field; via method return value across functions |
| L4 | Cross-file / framework semantics | Controller -> ServiceA -> ServiceB -> sink; Spring4Shell SpEL semantics |
| L5 | gadget chain | multiple safe classes combined into dangerous reachability (CC deserialization chain abstraction) |

Beyond the base grading, two "long-horizon / complex task" sample families specifically validate LLM **planning** and **consistency**:
- **Long-horizon tasks (LT series)**: cross-file tracing / framework state machine / gadget chain reconstruction / multi-hop concatenation / version gating — see [`benchmark/README.md`](benchmark/README.md) §3.
- **Code quality / performance DoS + LGTM gaps (PERF/TB/REFLECT/FMT/HOST/XSLT/FWD/SEED series)**: slow SQL, resource leaks, reflection injection, trust boundary, format-string injection, etc., aligned with the LGTM/CodeQL Java rule pack.

### Current Sample Scale

> Data source: `benchmark/expectedresults.csv` (source of truth, kept in two-way sync with `// [CHECKPOINT]` annotations in source; `validate_checkpoints.py` exits 0)

- **782** machine-readable checkpoint annotations (covering existing `src/main` vulnerabilities + `benchmark/cases` gradient samples + long-horizon tasks + code-quality/perf-DoS + LGTM-gap + logic-flaw samples + **atomic-paradigm families TCM/SBM/DBG/STR** + **scenario-orchestration families (detection-pressure / cascade / multi-vuln chain / branch-dead-end)**)
- **414 VULN** (should be reported) + **368 SAFE** (should not be reported, used to compute TN/FP)
- Difficulty distribution: L0 x 18, L1 x 165, L2 x 184, L3 x 181, L4 x 141, L5 x 93 (full L0-L5 gradient)
- CWE coverage: **86 categories** (VULN only). Top: Expression Injection (917), Deserialization (502), SQLi (89), Command Injection (78), Authorization Bypass (285), Hardcoded Credentials/Key (798), Business Logic (840), SSRF (918), IDOR (639), Path Traversal (22), ReDoS (1333), Performance DoS (400)
- Covers **189 categories** (slug), including all OWASP Top 10 2021 classes; **139** samples carry `trace=` path nodes (enables `--check-trace` path-correctness scoring)
- Special families: Long-horizon (LT) x 16, Code-quality/Perf-DoS (PERF) x 15, Trust-boundary (TB)/Reflection (REFLECT)/Format-string (FMT)/Hostname (HOST)/XSLT (XSLT)/Forward (FWD)/Seed (SEED) x 2 each
- **Atomic-paradigm families (TCM/SBM/DBG/STR)** x 64: distilled from real Fastjson / Spring Boot / Dubbo / Struts2 0day/1day into **library-agnostic** atomic danger patterns, reproduced self-contained with pure Java standard library.
- **Scenario-orchestration families (DE/OS/DEAD)** x 18: detection-pressure (dangerous sink reachable but monitored, `detection-pressure`), cross-service taint (RestTemplate round-trip, `cross-svc-taint`), cascade trust (system A config decides system B authorization, `cascade-trust`), multi-vulnerability chain (info-leak→privilege-escalation chain, `multi-vuln-chain`), live-branch dead-end (a live branch sanitizes the taint and becomes unreachable, `branch-dead-end`). Benchmarked against CyScenarioBench / FrontierCyber / Kimi K3 evaluations. See `plans/09-scenario-benchmark-orchestration-samples.md`.

### Atomic-Paradigm Families (TCM / SBM / DBG / STR)

To assess whether LLMs / harnesses can detect **same-principle** vulnerabilities, JSEF distills real 0day/1day from recent high-impact frameworks (Fastjson, Spring Boot, Dubbo, Struts2) into **library-agnostic** atomic danger patterns, and builds complex samples that share the same root cause but are decoupled from the original framework. Each family ships `vuln` + `sec` counterparts (for FP/TN) and is graded L1–L5, all carrying `// [CHECKPOINT]` annotations and **no original-framework class names** (pure standard-library semantics).

| Namespace | Distilled from | Atomic paradigm dimensions (MECE, non-overlapping) | Samples |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------|
| **TCM** | Fastjson deserialization | TCM-1 direct type selection · TCM-2 inheritance allowlist bypass · TCM-3 cache/second-parse bypass · TCM-4 private-field binding · TCM-5 property-as-code (dangerous getter/setter) | 20 |
| **SBM** | Spring Boot | SBM-1 binder traversal · SBM-2 declarative-config-as-expression · SBM-3 privileged-endpoint exposure · SBM-4 authz short-circuit bypass | 16 |
| **DBG** | Dubbo RPC | DBG-1 parser/format negotiation switch · DBG-2 cross-trust-boundary implicit trust (attachment) · DBG-3 class-name denylist bypass by encoding | 16 |
| **STR** | Struts2/OGNL | STR-1 double evaluation · STR-2 protocol-layer field injection · STR-3 eval exclusion-list / sandbox bypass | 12 |

**Design notes**:
- Abstraction principle: strip framework-specific mechanisms (e.g. "JSON-library autotype", "Web-framework SpEL") and keep only the cross-framework invariant danger combination — attacker controls type/data + system auto-invokes implicit methods + implicit method chain reaches a dangerous sink.
- No overlap with existing samples: deliberately avoids the repo's existing `JSEF-OGNL-*`/`JSEF-SPEL-*` single-layer expression injection, `JSEF-DESER-*` direct deserialization, etc.; covers only the **unique, unmodeled** atomic dimensions (e.g. OGNL double evaluation, Spring4Shell binder traversal, Dubbo parser negotiation).
- High discrimination: includes L4 cross-file, L5 gadget-chain, and cross-method-chain hard cases to separate tool/model capability tiers.
- Safety baseline: all dangerous calls are localhost-demo placeholders; no real exploit scripts.

Sample location: `benchmark/cases/{vuln,sec}/{tcm,sbm,dbg,str}/`; design docs: `plans/02-~05-*.md`.

Sample organization:
- `benchmark/cases/vuln/` and `benchmark/cases/sec/`: discriminating-difficulty gradient samples (with safe counterparts)
- `benchmark/cases/vuln/longtask/` and `benchmark/cases/vuln/perf/`: long-horizon and code-quality/perf-DoS dedicated samples
- `benchmark/cases/vendor/`: high-quality competitor samples abstracted from OWASP Benchmark / Juliet / PrimeVul / CVEfixes, with source-URL provenance

### How to Run & Cross-Compare

1. Start JSEF: `mvn clean package -DskipTests && java -jar target/*.jar`
2. Select the subject under test: a SAST tool (CodeQL/SonarQube/Snyk) + an LLM (switch models in Claude Code, using the same prompt `benchmark/prompts/vuln_hunt.md`)
3. Each subject scans `benchmark/cases/` once, producing SARIF or `id -> {hit,file,line}` results, recording time
4. Run the scoring script for cross-comparison metrics (from repo root):
   ```bash
   python3 benchmark/scripts/scorecard.py --expected benchmark/expectedresults.csv --result <result.json|.sarif> --name <subject-name>
   ```
   Outputs Recall / Precision / **Youden Score (TPR - FPR)** / average time / timeout count / report conciseness / coverage completeness, grouped by CWE and level.
